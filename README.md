# Term-Project-Proposal
This is the term project proposal for the Internet and Websystems Class
This Term paper talks about an idea I had on the Sentiment Analysis of Reddit Data and also Analyzing the Attacks on Social Media with regards to machine learning security . There are basically two parts to this paper . First about the reddit data analysis and then the social media attacks on the reddit data analysis using machine learning security . The first part is done using a project I am working on and the second part is based on the research I did on several papers based on machine learning security.
